        <p>ABOUT ME</p>

      </aside>
      <P>My name is Erica San Miguel. I was born and raised in San Antonio, but spent eleven years in Dallas. I have a bachelor of arts in fashion design and have been working in and around the subject for fiften plus years. After a lot of thought and debate I decided to take my creative skills over to coding, and began taking the UTSA full-stack bootcamp with the goal of getting into front-end web development.</P>
      <p>My goals are to learn full-stack development and UI/UX while also utilizing my art and design skills to create beautiful and fun applications that are user friendly. Short-term goals of mine are to be able to create my own simple organization app, and build small business websites for my friends and family. I would also like take the things I learn to aid in the growing tech industry of San Antonio.</p>
